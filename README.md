## BullFrog: Online Schema Evolution via Lazy Evaluation

## Overview

**BullFrog** is a system that performs immediate schema migration in a single step, without advanced warning or time toprepare, including backwards-incompatible migrations. It implements *concurrency control algorithms* and *data structures* to enable concurrent processing of schema migration operations with post-migration transactions, while ensuring *exactly-once* migration of all old data into the physical layout required by the new schema. 

BullFrog is an open source extension to PostgreSQL. Experiments using this prototype over a TPC-C based workload (supplemented to include schema migrations) show that BullFrog can achieve *zero-downtime* migration to non-trivial new schemas with *near-invisible* impact on transaction throughput and latency.

> This repository contains an experimental prototype of the system, which is not suitable for use in production.
  
## Benchmark

We extended Oltp-bench framework to measure online schema migration. You can find the experimental code in [BullFrog-Oltpbench](https://github.com/DSLAM-UMD/BullFrog-Oltpbench). If you have any questions about online schema migration on TPC-C Benchmark, feel free to [contact us](gangliao@cs.umd.edu).
